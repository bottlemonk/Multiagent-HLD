Power Apps Code Analyzer
A Python-based tool that automatically analyzes Microsoft Power Apps code files and generates comprehensive High-Level Design (HLD) documentation using Large Language Models and LangGraph workflow orchestration.
üöÄ Features

Automated Code Analysis: Scans Power Apps source files (.fx.yaml and .json formats)
Intelligent File Processing: Handles both modern Power Apps (.fx.yaml) and legacy formats (.json)
LLM-Powered Summaries: Generates detailed summaries for each code file
High-Level Design Generation: Synthesizes individual file summaries into comprehensive HLD documentation
Workflow Orchestration: Uses LangGraph for robust, visual workflow management
Error Handling: Graceful handling of file encoding issues and processing errors

üìã Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Local LM Studio instance running on http://192.168.0.110:1234/v1
Power Apps source code in a src/ directory

üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Clone this repository:

bashgit clone <repository-url>
cd powerapp-analyzer

Install required dependencies:

bashpip install langgraph langchain openai ipython

Ensure your LM Studio is running with the Qwen 3-4B model at the specified endpoint.

üîß Configuration
LLM Configuration
The tool is configured to use a local LM Studio instance. Update the following parameters in the code if needed:
pythonllm = ChatOpenAI(
    openai_api_base="http://192.168.0.110:1234/v1",  # Your LM Studio URL
    openai_api_key="lmstudio",                       # API key (if required)
    model="qwen/qwen3-4b",                          # Model name
    temperature=0.1                                  # Temperature setting
)
File Processing Priority

Primary: .fx.yaml files (modern Power Apps format)
Fallback: .json files in controls/ folder (legacy format)

üöÄ Usage

Place your Power Apps source files in the src/ directory
Run the analyzer:

bashpython analyzer.py

The tool will:

Scan and read all relevant files
Generate individual file summaries
Create a comprehensive HLD document
Display the workflow graph
Print the final HLD document



üìä Workflow Overview
The analysis follows a three-stage LangGraph workflow:
mermaidgraph LR
    A[Read Files] --> B[File Analysis]
    B --> C[HLD Generation]
Stage 1: File Reading (read_files)

Scans the src/ directory for Power Apps files
Prioritizes .fx.yaml files over .json files
Handles encoding issues gracefully
Collects file metadata and content

Stage 2: File Analysis (node_1)

Analyzes each file individually using LLM
Extracts key information:

Screens, components, and entities
Data sources and variables
Navigation logic and user interactions
Business rules and special processing



Stage 3: HLD Generation (node_2)

Synthesizes individual file summaries
Generates comprehensive documentation including:

Executive Summary
Application Architecture Overview
Data Model
Navigation and User Flow
Custom Logic and Key Interactions
Integration Points
Special Features and Business Rules



üìÑ Output Format
The tool generates a detailed High-Level Design document containing:

Executive Summary: Business context and purpose
Architecture Overview: Key modules and their relationships
Data Model: Entities, data sources, and relationships
Navigation Flow: User journeys and screen transitions
Custom Logic: Important formulas and business rules
Integration Points: External service connections
Component Summary: Screen and component responsibilities

üîß Customization
Modifying Analysis Prompts
Edit the node1_prompt and system_prompt_hld variables to customize the analysis focus or output format.
Adding New File Types
Extend the read_files function to support additional file formats:
pythonif file.endswith('.your_extension'):
    # Add processing logic
Changing Output Format
Modify the node_2 function to save output in different formats (PDF, HTML, etc.).
üêõ Troubleshooting
Common Issues

LM Studio Connection Failed

Ensure LM Studio is running on the specified URL
Check firewall settings
Verify the model is loaded


No Files Found

Verify Power Apps files are in the src/ directory
Check file extensions (.fx.yaml or .json)
Ensure proper directory structure


Encoding Errors

The tool handles common encoding issues automatically
Check file integrity if problems persist


Memory Issues

Large applications may require more memory
Consider processing files in smaller batches



üìà Performance Tips

File Organization: Keep related files in logical subdirectories
Model Selection: Use appropriate model size for your hardware
Batch Processing: For large applications, consider processing subsets of files
